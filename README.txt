Worked a bit with Kirsten, with separate code.

2. Everything is complete except for piping (we didn't do single or multipiping).

3. Our reaping children method doesn't work as planned even though we thought we
should catch children with an if statement in our main loop function.

Additionally, processes exited via ^C aren't properly killed and become zombie processes.

Our file descriptors don't always reset properly when dealing with redirection.

We didn't attempt any extra credit.

4. When redirecting we assume input is in the form < <file1> or > <file2>.
